# PostureDetection-AirPodsProAPI
In this repository,  developed an application that detects posture and encourages posture improvement using an API that can acquire sensor information from AirPodsPro.

Specifically, it acquires the acceleration sensor information in AirPodsPro and reflects it to the 3D character in real time.

By using this application during desk work, etc., posture can be constantly detected, and a notification is generated when posture deterioration is detected for a certain period of time or longer.

The concept of this application is to reduce fatigue caused by posture deterioration during desk work.

Therefore, healing music is played while the application is in use, and when posture deteriorates, a short notification with sound is provided so as not to interfere with concentration.
